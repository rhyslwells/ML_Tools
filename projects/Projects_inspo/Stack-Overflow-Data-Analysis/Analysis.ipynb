    "I will to look at Stack Overflow survey data (available online: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) from year 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (as data from 2019 is not available to be downloaded yet in raw state) in order to answer questons that bother me.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation behind asking questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "I have 6 years experience in IT industry. In the past I have worked as and Android Developer (Java Android), Research Scientist (C++), Automation Engineer (Java, Ruby, Python) and since last one year I took Machine Learning Enginner position (Python). As I consider my IT career quite successful so far there are few things in my life that haven't been finished. I earned Mechatronics Engineer title in the past and I finished whole Master Degree course - yet haven't attended to defend the title. This is because I had a chance to attend one year internship programme (https://www.eu-japan.eu/events/vulcanus-japan) in year 2013 and it's policy conflicted my university policy. Skills were always more important for me than titles and certificates. Consequently I've quit my university as an Engineer. From time to time I still ask myself a question whether I should return to university. I want to use this project as an opportunity to answer it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is university title necessary in order to become a successful programmer?\n",
    "2. Is university education connected to salary and job satisfaction?\n",
    "3. What programming language is most promising to learn - gives best trade off between received salary and effort (is university education rather required or not)?"

    "- There is a lot of information about programmers in all the surveys.\n",
    "- Each survey covers slightly different topics but there should be enough information on education, progamming language preferences, job satisfaction. There is less information about salary though (50% of each group).\n",
    "- Each survey has different column names even for the same features. \n",
    "- Same features between survey has different value types or ranges. \n",
    "- In order to compare change between programmer preferences across the years it will be necessary to normalize features between surveys.\n",
    "- Sometimes feature change it's meaning. For example in survey from 2015, 2016 there is a job satisfaction but in 2017 and 2018 values such as job satisfaction and career satisfaciton appeared. Job can be described as \"current job\" or \"programmer overall\". This is uncertain how to treat it.\n",
    "- There are really interesting insights in some survey like \"EducationImportant\" in survey from 2017. It is unfortunately only available for that year.\n",
    "- It is important to point out that outcome of this analysis might be biased as ~100k people (after removing missing data) is only small portion of programmers across the world. Apart from that there might be much more factors why somebody is satisfied from their job (e.g. always worked in well managed companies with nice atmosphere, country situation and so on)."
