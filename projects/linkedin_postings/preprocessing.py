# 1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
#    - Check for missing values and handle them appropriately. You've already done this for columns like `remote_allowed`, `formatted_experience_level`, and others.
#    - Drop unnecessary columns like `skills_desc` where the majority of the data is missing.
#    - Create new features where necessary, such as `posting_effectiveness` based on the number of applies.
