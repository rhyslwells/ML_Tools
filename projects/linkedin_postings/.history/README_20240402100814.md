In this project we analyse job data scraped from LinkedIn to explore the data and derive insights.

The goal is to understand the structure and characteristics of the data, clean and preprocess it, analyze relationships and patterns within the data, answer specific questions about the job postings, provide a prediction model for salary range, and generate a final report of the findings.
