2024-11-27 16:48:24+00:00,LLM-ABBA: Understanding time series via symbolic approximation,"['Erin Carson', 'Xinye Chen', 'Cheng Kang']","The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been
demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation,
one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the
remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time
series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the
embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The
symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian
bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in
preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in
terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.
  In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA
into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By
symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent
state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification
tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to
\kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating
the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the
transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks,
LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER)
benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to
recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also
seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18506v4,cs.LG
2024-01-28 21:23:13+00:00,Evaluation of k-means time series clustering based on z-normalization and NP-Free,"['Ming-Chang Lee', 'Jia-Chun Lin', 'Volker Stolz']","Despite the widespread use of k-means time series clustering in various
domains, there exists a gap in the literature regarding its comprehensive
evaluation with different time series normalization approaches. This paper
seeks to fill this gap by conducting a thorough performance evaluation of
k-means time series clustering on real-world open-source time series datasets.
The evaluation focuses on two distinct normalization techniques:
z-normalization and NP-Free. The former is one of the most commonly used
normalization approach for time series. The latter is a real-time time series
representation approach, which can serve as a time series normalization
approach. The primary objective of this paper is to assess the impact of these
two normalization techniques on k-means time series clustering in terms of its
clustering quality. The experiments employ the silhouette score, a
well-established metric for evaluating the quality of clusters in a dataset. By
systematically investigating the performance of k-means time series clustering
with these two normalization techniques, this paper addresses the current gap
in k-means time series clustering evaluation and contributes valuable insights
to the development of time series clustering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15773v1,cs.LG
2023-12-31 08:23:24+00:00,MSGNet: Learning Multi-Scale Inter-Series Correlations for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting,"['Wanlin Cai', 'Yuxuan Liang', 'Xianggen Liu', 'Jianshuai Feng', 'Yuankai Wu']","Multivariate time series forecasting poses an ongoing challenge across
various disciplines. Time series data often exhibit diverse intra-series and
inter-series correlations, contributing to intricate and interwoven
dependencies that have been the focus of numerous studies. Nevertheless, a
significant research gap remains in comprehending the varying inter-series
correlations across different time scales among multiple time series, an area
that has received limited attention in the literature. To bridge this gap, this
paper introduces MSGNet, an advanced deep learning model designed to capture
the varying inter-series correlations across multiple time scales using
frequency domain analysis and adaptive graph convolution. By leveraging
frequency domain analysis, MSGNet effectively extracts salient periodic
patterns and decomposes the time series into distinct time scales. The model
incorporates a self-attention mechanism to capture intra-series dependencies,
while introducing an adaptive mixhop graph convolution layer to autonomously
learn diverse inter-series correlations within each time scale. Extensive
experiments are conducted on several real-world datasets to showcase the
effectiveness of MSGNet. Furthermore, MSGNet possesses the ability to
automatically learn explainable multi-scale inter-series correlations,
exhibiting strong generalization capabilities even when applied to
out-of-distribution samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00423v1,cs.LG
2021-10-27 11:14:49+00:00,MixSeq: Connecting Macroscopic Time Series Forecasting with Microscopic Time Series Data,"['Zhibo Zhu', 'Ziqi Liu', 'Ge Jin', 'Zhiqiang Zhang', 'Lei Chen', 'Jun Zhou', 'Jianyong Zhou']","Time series forecasting is widely used in business intelligence, e.g.,
forecast stock market price, sales, and help the analysis of data trend. Most
time series of interest are macroscopic time series that are aggregated from
microscopic data. However, instead of directly modeling the macroscopic time
series, rare literature studied the forecasting of macroscopic time series by
leveraging data on the microscopic level. In this paper, we assume that the
microscopic time series follow some unknown mixture probabilistic
distributions. We theoretically show that as we identify the ground truth
latent mixture components, the estimation of time series from each component
could be improved because of lower variance, thus benefitting the estimation of
macroscopic time series as well. Inspired by the power of Seq2seq and its
variants on the modeling of time series data, we propose Mixture of Seq2seq
(MixSeq), an end2end mixture model to cluster microscopic time series, where
all the components come from a family of Seq2seq models parameterized by
different parameters. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
data show the superiority of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14354v1,cs.LG
2020-01-21 14:48:43+00:00,Motif Difference Field: A Simple and Effective Image Representation of Time Series for Classification,"['Yadong Zhang', 'Xin Chen']","Time series motifs play an important role in the time series analysis. The
motif-based time series clustering is used for the discovery of higher-order
patterns or structures in time series data. Inspired by the convolutional
neural network (CNN) classifier based on the image representations of time
series, motif difference field (MDF) is proposed. Compared to other image
representations of time series, MDF is simple and easy to construct. With the
Fully Convolution Network (FCN) as the classifier, MDF demonstrates the
superior performance on the UCR time series dataset in benchmark with other
time series classification methods. It is interesting to find that the triadic
time series motifs give the best result in the test. Due to the motif
clustering reflected in MDF, the significant motifs are detected with the help
of the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). The areas in MDF
with high weight in Grad-CAM have a high contribution from the significant
motifs with the desired ordinal patterns associated with the signature patterns
in time series. However, the signature patterns cannot be identified with the
neural network classifiers directly based on the time series.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07582v1,cs.LG
2019-03-07 09:29:31+00:00,GRATIS: GeneRAting TIme Series with diverse and controllable characteristics,"['Yanfei Kang', 'Rob J Hyndman', 'Feng Li']","The explosion of time series data in recent years has brought a flourish of
new time series analysis methods, for forecasting, clustering, classification
and other tasks. The evaluation of these new methods requires either collecting
or simulating a diverse set of time series benchmarking data to enable reliable
comparisons against alternative approaches. We propose GeneRAting TIme Series
with diverse and controllable characteristics, named GRATIS, with the use of
mixture autoregressive (MAR) models. We simulate sets of time series using MAR
models and investigate the diversity and coverage of the generated time series
in a time series feature space. By tuning the parameters of the MAR models,
GRATIS is also able to efficiently generate new time series with controllable
features. In general, as a costless surrogate to the traditional data
collection approach, GRATIS can be used as an evaluation tool for tasks such as
time series forecasting and classification. We illustrate the usefulness of our
time series generation process through a time series forecasting application.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02787v2,stat.ML
2015-03-17 12:41:30+00:00,Ultra-Fast Shapelets for Time Series Classification,"['Martin Wistuba', 'Josif Grabocka', 'Lars Schmidt-Thieme']","Time series shapelets are discriminative subsequences and their similarity to
a time series can be used for time series classification. Since the discovery
of time series shapelets is costly in terms of time, the applicability on long
or multivariate time series is difficult. In this work we propose Ultra-Fast
Shapelets that uses a number of random shapelets. It is shown that Ultra-Fast
Shapelets yield the same prediction quality as current state-of-the-art
shapelet-based time series classifiers that carefully select the shapelets by
being by up to three orders of magnitudes. Since this method allows a
ultra-fast shapelet discovery, using shapelets for long multivariate time
series classification becomes feasible.
  A method for using shapelets for multivariate time series is proposed and
Ultra-Fast Shapelets is proven to be successful in comparison to
state-of-the-art multivariate time series classifiers on 15 multivariate time
series datasets from various domains. Finally, time series derivatives that
have proven to be useful for other time series classifiers are investigated for
the shapelet-based classifiers. It is shown that they have a positive impact
and that they are easy to integrate with a simple preprocessing step, without
the need of adapting the shapelet discovery algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.05018v1,cs.LG
