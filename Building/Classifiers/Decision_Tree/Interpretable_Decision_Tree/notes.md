# **Building Interpretable Decision Trees**

In this post, we explore how to build and interpret Decision Trees using a systematic and interpretable approach. While we use the Titanic dataset for its simplicity and structure, the method and workflow we outline can be applied to many other datasets. For a deeper dive into Decision Trees, check out [this detailed guide](link). You can also find the complete script for this walkthrough [here](link).

Our goal is to build an interpretable Decision Tree that accurately predicts whether a passenger will survive while maintaining the predictive power of the model.

## **1. The Dataset**

The Titanic dataset is a classic binary classification problem where the goal is to predict passenger survival (1 for survived, 0 for not survived). Before diving into the modeling process, we preprocess the data by:
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., converting "Sex" into numeric values).
- Imputing missing values (e.g., filling missing "Age" values with the mean).

Here is a preview of the cleaned dataset after preprocessing:

`df.head()`

This ensures a clean and consistent dataset for training the Decision Tree model.

## **2. Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search**

To identify the best Decision Tree configuration, we use **GridSearchCV** ([link to reference](link)) to systematically tune key hyperparameters such as:
- `max_depth` ([link](link)): Controls the maximum depth of the tree.
- `min_samples_split` ([link](link)): The minimum number of samples required to split a node.
- `criterion` ([link to Gini](link), [link to Entropy](link)): The function to measure the quality of a split.

**Code Snippet: Performing Grid Search**
```python
# Define the parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'max_depth': [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4],
    'criterion': ['gini', 'entropy']
}

# Perform grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42), param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Extract best parameters
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
print("Best Parameters:", best_params)
```

Results of the best hyperparameters: [[insert best parameters]]

This ensures that the model is neither underfitting nor overfitting. Below is a visualization of the tuned Decision Tree model:

## **3. When and How to Perform Feature Selection**

Feature selection is crucial for simplifying the model and improving its interpretability. Depending on the workflow, it can be performed:
1. **Before Pruning**:
   - Reduces the input space early.
   - Leverages the full complexity of the model to determine feature importance.
   - Helps mitigate overfitting.

2. **After Pruning**:
   - Aligns with a simplified model.
   - Focuses on interpretability by prioritizing simplicity over raw performance.

**Suggested Workflow**: Since the Titanic dataset is relatively small, and we aim to maintain predictive power, we perform feature selection **before pruning**.

## **4. Using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) helps iteratively remove the least important features, allowing us to identify the optimal subset for our Decision Tree.

**Code Snippet: Selecting Features with RFE**
```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE

# Apply RFE to the best model
rfe = RFE(estimator=best_model, n_features_to_select=3)
rfe.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Extract selected features
selected_features = [features[i] for i in range(len(features)) if rfe.support_[i]]
print("Selected Features:", selected_features)
```

After running RFE, the selected features are: [[insert table of selected features]]

This subset is then used for subsequent modeling steps. Below is a visualization comparing model accuracy against the number of selected features:

## **5. Pruning the Decision Tree for Interpretability**

Pruning reduces model complexity by trimming branches that add little predictive value. We use **cost-complexity pruning** to identify the optimal pruning threshold (`ccp_alpha`). This approach ensures pruning is automated and metric-driven, making it more robust and generalizable.

**Code Snippet: Pruning the Decision Tree**
```python
# Get pruning path
ccp_path = base_interpretable_model.cost_complexity_pruning_path(X_train_rfe, y_train)
ccp_alphas = ccp_path.ccp_alphas
```

We evaluate the model for various `ccp_alpha` values using cross-validation on the feature-selected data. Below are the results:

The pruned Decision Tree achieves a balance between interpretability and predictive performance. Here's a visualization of the pruned model:

## **Conclusion**

By combining feature selection, pruning, and decision rule extraction, we created an interpretable Decision Tree optimized for the Titanic dataset. Key takeaways from this workflow include:
- Use **GridSearchCV** for systematic hyperparameter tuning.
- Perform feature selection to simplify the model and enhance interpretability.
- Apply pruning to create a robust, interpretable model.
- Extract decision rules to understand and communicate model predictions effectively.

This workflow demonstrates that it’s possible to balance interpretability and predictive power, even with complex datasets. Try applying this approach to your own datasets and share your results!
