Good question — once you’ve generated your HTML documentation with **pdoc**, publishing it to a web server depends on your hosting setup. Below are the most common and practical options for deploying it.

---

## **1. Publish via GitHub Pages (recommended for most projects)**

If your project is on GitHub, this is the easiest and most common way to host pdoc-generated HTML.

### **Steps**

1. **Generate the docs**

   ```bash
   pdoc your_module --output-dir docs
   ```

2. **Commit and push to GitHub**

   ```bash
   git add docs/
   git commit -m "Add generated documentation"
   git push
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**

   * Go to your repository on GitHub → **Settings → Pages**.
   * Under **Source**, choose `main` (or your branch) and select `/docs` as the folder.
   * Save changes.

4. **Access your documentation**
   After a few minutes, your docs will be available at:

   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/
   ```

This method is simple, version-controlled, and free.

## **2. Serve documentation locally or internally**

If you just want to **run it on a local or internal server**, use Python’s built-in web server:

```bash
cd docs
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open in a browser:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

For internal networks, replace `localhost` with your machine’s IP.

## **3. Deploy to a web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)**

If you manage your own web server or have cloud hosting:

1. Generate the documentation:

   ```bash
   pdoc your_module --output-dir docs
   ```

2. Copy the contents of `docs/` to your server’s public HTML directory. For example:

   ```bash
   scp -r docs/* username@yourserver.com:/var/www/html/docs/
   ```

3. Access it in your browser:

   ```
   https://yourserver.com/docs/
   ```

This method is ideal for organizational or production documentation.

## **4. Publish via a cloud storage or hosting service**

If you don’t have a dedicated server, you can host static HTML via:

* **GitHub Pages** (as shown above)
* **Netlify**

  * Connect your repo and set build command to `pdoc your_module --output-dir docs`
  * Set the publish directory to `docs`
* **Vercel**

  * Similar to Netlify; simply point to the `docs` directory as the output.
* **AWS S3 / CloudFront**

  * Upload `docs/` contents to an S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled.
  * Use CloudFront for a CDN distribution if needed.

---

## **5. Automate the process (optional)**

You can automate publishing with a **GitHub Action** that regenerates and deploys documentation whenever you push code.

Example workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`):

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy Docs

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: pip install pdoc
      - run: pdoc your_module --output-dir docs
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./docs
```

This automatically rebuilds and republishes your pdoc documentation on GitHub Pages.

| Method            | When to Use                 | Command / Action                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub Pages      | Public/open-source projects | Push `/docs` and enable Pages                   |
| Local server      | Internal viewing            | `python -m http.server`                         |
| Custom web server | Private or enterprise use   | `scp -r docs/* user@server:/var/www/html/docs/` |
| Netlify/Vercel    | Cloud-hosted static site    | Connect repo and publish `docs`                 |
| CI automation     | Continuous deployment       | Use GitHub Actions or CI script                 |

Would you like me to show a ready-to-use GitHub Action file that automatically regenerates and deploys your `pdoc` docs to GitHub Pages on every push?
