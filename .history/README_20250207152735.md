This repository contains a series of explorations to help implement and understand various machine learning concepts. The goal is to develop a flexible pipeline for testing different ideas and techniques, with insights from the explorations integrated where applicable. The project is also linked with the [Data Archive](https://github.com/rhyslwells/Data-Archive), which provides additional context and resources.

## Structure

- **Datasets**: Contains datasets used for various ML tasks and experiments.
- **Explorations**: Includes scripts and notebooks that demonstrate different ML concepts and experiments. These serve as references to inform and enhance the pipeline.
- **Pipeline**: A modular pipeline designed to incorporate and test different ML techniques. The explorations will be used to adapt and extend this pipeline when relevant.
