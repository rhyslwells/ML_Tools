# **Building Interpretable Decision Trees:

In this post, we explore how to build interpret Decision Tree. We use the titanic dataset for its clean and simple structure - but the method and workflow are key here. For a deep dive into Decision Trees, check out [this detailed guide](link). You can also find the complete script for this walkthrough [here](link).

We’ll cover key steps, including hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, pruning.

our goal is to build an interpretable Decision Tree that accurately predicts whether a passenger will survive or not. - that maintains the predictive power of the model.

## **1. The Dataset**

The Titanic dataset is a classic example of a binary classification problem, where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

Here is the cleaned dataset after basic processing - encoding categorical variables and imputing missing data

## **2. Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search**

To identify the best Decision Tree configuration, we use **GridSearchCV** (link to refernece) to tune key hyperparameters (link to hyperparamter tuning) like `max_depth` (link), `min_samples_split` (link), and `criterion` (gini - link, entropy - link). This ensures the model is neither underfitting nor overfitting.

**Code Snippet: Performing Grid Search**
```python
# Define the parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'max_depth': [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4],
    'criterion': ['gini', 'entropy']
}

# Perform grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42), param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Extract best parameters
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
print("Best Parameters:", best_params)
```

[[insert best paramaters]]

This step leverages a systematic search for the best hyperparameters, maximizing model performance, with the results of different parameter combinations.

## **3. When and How to Perform Feature Selection**

Feature selection is crucial for simplifying the model and improving interpretability. The timing of feature selection—before or after pruning—depends on your objectives. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Feature Selection Before Pruning**
- Focuses on reducing the input space early.
- Leverages the full complexity of the model to determine feature importance.
- Mitigates overfitting by starting with fewer features.

### **Feature Selection After Pruning**
- Prioritizes simplicity by working with an already-simplified model.
- Aligns feature selection with the final interpretable tree structure.

**Suggested Workflow**: Since we want to maintain the predictive power of the model, and the datset is relaticesly small, we do feature selection before pruning..

## **4. Using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**

We use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to iteratively remove the least important features and identify the optimal subset for our Decision Tree.

**Code Snippet: Selecting Features with RFE**
```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE

# Apply RFE to the best model
rfe = RFE(estimator=best_model, n_features_to_select=3)
rfe.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Extract selected features
selected_features = [features[i] for i in range(len(features)) if rfe.support_[i]]
print("Selected Features:", selected_features)
```

After feature selection, the top 3 features are used for subsequent training. [[insert image]] comparing model accuracy against the number of features.

## **5. Pruning the Decision Tree for Interpretability**

Pruning reduces model complexity by removing branches that add minimal predictive value. We use **cost-complexity pruning** to identify the optimal pruning threshold (`ccp_alpha`).

**Code Snippet: Pruning the Decision Tree**
```python
# Get pruning path
ccp_path = base_interpretable_model.cost_complexity_pruning_path(X_train_rfe, y_train)
ccp_alphas = ccp_path.ccp_alphas
```

We determine the accuracy of the base model for different `ccp_alpha` values we use cross validation on the feature selected data.

## **Conclusion**

By combining feature selection, pruning, and decision rule extraction, we created an interpretable Decision Tree optimized for the Titanic dataset. Key takeaways include:
- Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Perform feature selection after pruning for interpretability.
- Extract decision rules to understand and communicate model predictions.
