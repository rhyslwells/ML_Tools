# Random Forests

## Interpretability

Interpretability is indirect due to the hundreds of underlying trees that prevent direct inspection. Common interpretation tools include:
- Feature importance
- SHAP values
- Partial dependence plots

## Model Properties

**Low Variance Model**: Random forests achieve low variance through averaging, making predictions stable when data slightly changes. This property makes them common for production pipelines.

## Extrapolation Limitations

Random forests cannot extrapolate outside the training range. Predictions become the average value in the nearest region.

**Example**: 
- Training data: $x \in [0,10]$
- Prediction at $x=20$ typically returns values close to the maximum training region

## Function Approximation

Random forests approximate functions through local partitioning of feature space, creating piecewise regions:

$$f(x) = \begin{cases} 3.2 & x_1 < 1.2 \\ 4.7 & x_1 \ge 1.2 \end{cases}$$

The forest smooths discontinuities through averaging.

## Training Procedure

Random forests follow a deterministic training procedure:
1. Draw bootstrap samples
2. Grow decision trees
3. At each split, choose a random subset of features
4. Optimize each split with: $\min \text{MSE}$

No search over mathematical forms occurs.

## Symbolic Approximation via Model Distillation

### Why Approximate with Symbolic Regression

Random forests provide strong predictive accuracy and robustness to noise. Symbolic regression provides interpretable functional structure and compact mathematical representation. Combining them produces a high-accuracy model with a simplified analytical description.

### Distillation Pipeline

**Step 1** — Train the random forest:
$$f_{RF}(x)$$

**Step 2** — Generate synthetic training data:
Sample inputs from the feature space: $X^* = \{x_1^*, x_2^*, ..., x_m^*\}$

Compute labels using the forest: $y_i^* = f_{RF}(x_i^*)$

New dataset: $D^* = (X^*, y^*)$ represents the response surface learned by the forest.

**Step 3** — Run symbolic regression:
Train symbolic regression on $(X^*, y^*)$ to obtain:
$$f_{SR}(x) \approx f_{RF}(x)$$

### Benefits of Distillation

- **Model compression**: A forest with hundreds of trees becomes a single formula
  - Example: Random forest (500 trees) → Symbolic formula (8 terms)
- **Interpretability**: Exposes relationships such as polynomial growth, logarithmic scaling, interaction terms
- **Analytical manipulation**: Compute derivatives $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i}$, integrals, asymptotic behaviour

### Limitations

- **Approximation error**: Symbolic regression cannot always perfectly reproduce the forest surface; complex forests may require large formulas
- **Feature interactions**: Forests can capture extremely complex interaction boundaries that symbolic regression may simplify
- **Stability**: Symbolic approximations may vary depending on sampling strategy and search randomness

## Comparing Symbolic Formula to Forest Predictions

### Prediction Agreement

The most direct comparison measures prediction difference:

$$MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum (y_{RF} - y_{SR})^2$$
$$MAE = \frac{1}{n}\sum |y_{RF} - y_{SR}|$$

These measure how closely the symbolic formula reproduces the forest.

### Functional Similarity

Functional distance between models:
$$\Delta = \mathbb{E}_x[|f_{RF}(x) - f_{SR}(x)|]$$

Small $\Delta$ indicates the symbolic model is a good surrogate.

### Behavioural Diagnostics

- **Partial dependence comparison**: Compare $PD_{RF}(x_j)$ vs $PD_{SR}(x_j)$ to verify the symbolic formula reproduces the same trend for individual features
- **Interaction analysis**: Verify that complex interactions like $x_1 \times x_2$ captured by the forest are approximated in the symbolic formula

### Out-of-Sample Validation

Evaluate both models on validation data:

| Model | $R^2$ |
|-------|-------|
| Random forest | 0.92 |
| Symbolic regression | 0.84 |

The symbolic model typically sacrifices some predictive accuracy for interpretability.

### Complexity Comparison

Compare model sizes:
- Random forest: 400 trees, depth ≈ 10, ~10000 decision nodes
- Symbolic formula: $y = 2.1x_1 + 0.3x_2^2 - 0.8\log(x_3)$

Symbolic models are dramatically smaller.

### Residual Analysis

Evaluate residuals: $r(x) = f_{RF}(x) - f_{SR}(x)$

Typical pattern: symbolic model captures global trend, forest captures local irregularities.
