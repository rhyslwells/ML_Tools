# ML_Tools: Machine Learning Explorations  

This personal repository contains a series of structured explorations aimed at implementing and understanding various machine learning concepts. The primary objective is to develop a **flexible and modular pipeline** for testing ideas and techniques. Insights from these explorations are integrated into the pipeline where applicable.  

This project is closely linked to the [Data Archive](https://github.com/rhyslwells/Data-Archive), which provides additional datasets, context, and supporting resources.  

## Repository Structure  

- **Datasets**  
  Contains datasets used in various machine learning experiments. These datasets serve as the foundation for testing and validating different techniques.  

- **Explorations**  
  A collection of scripts and notebooks that showcase specific machine learning concepts, methodologies, and experiments. These explorations serve as references to refine and enhance the pipeline.  

- **Pipeline**  
  A modular framework designed for integrating and testing different machine learning techniques. Insights from the explorations are used to iteratively improve and extend this pipeline.
