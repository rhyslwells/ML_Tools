Problem Context: Fraud Detection in Transactions
We have a dataset of financial transactions, and we want to train and evaluate models to detect fraudulent ones.

Idea: to turn ML_Tools or a folder of it into  a ml pipeline instead of straight exploration files, so that it feads into the pipeline.
