# ML_Tools: Machine Learning Explorations  

This personal repository contains a series of structured explorations aimed at implementing and understanding various machine learning concepts. **The primary objective is to develop a repository of generalised scripts that can be used to implement concepts easily.**The secondary objective is to develop a **flexible and modular pipeline** for testing ideas and techniques.

This project is closely linked to the [Data Archive](https://rhyslwells.github.io/Data-Archive/), which provides context, and supporting resources.

## Repository Structure  

- **Datasets**: Contains datasets used in various machine learning experiments. These datasets serve as the foundation for testing and validating different techniques.  

- **Explorations**: A collection of scripts and notebooks that showcase specific machine learning concepts, methodologies, and experiments.
